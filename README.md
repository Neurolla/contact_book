Here is your **Contact Book README rewritten in your personal GitHub style** — clean, friendly, structured, with emojis and a polished tone (just like your Happy Numbers and Monty Hall README files).

# 📇 Contact Book

A simple and clean **Python console application** that allows you to store, view, edit, and delete your contacts.
Each contact can include a **name**, **phone number**, **email**, and **address** — all managed inside a lightweight, efficient data structure.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project is built using a **Python dictionary** to store contact information.
Dictionaries offer excellent performance for this use case:

```
O(1) → Add
O(1) → Retrieve
O(1) → Edit
O(1) → Delete
```

Fast, minimal, and perfect for practicing data structures & clean code.
